nginx:
- installed nginx
- cs555.conf file binds 127.0.0.1:80 to 127.0.0.1:5000 (which is where my gunicorn is running)
     put it in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled, shouldn't need to do anything else

flask:
- db.py was run to make a simple db in database.db which just has two entries
     used the tutorial here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-an-sqlite-database-in-a-flask-application
     used DB Browser for SQLite to make sure the database looked okay
- cs555.py is the flask app which is still in work (only the home function works, index and delete are placeholders), it currently displays the title of the first database entry
- make sure gunicorn and flask are installed
- i made a python virtual env in the folder with:
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install gunicorn flask
- make sure in virtual environment (venv/bin/activate) then start the flask app behind gunicorn with, this starts the app using port 5000:
     gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:5000 cs555:app

if you have nginx and gunicorn properly setup, you should be able to see the webpage which just says "Test1" at 127.0.0.1:5000 and at localhost in the browser
