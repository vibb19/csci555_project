nginx:
- installed nginx
- cs555.conf file binds 127.0.0.1:80 to 127.0.0.1:5000 (which is where my gunicorn is running)
     put it in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled, shouldn't need to do anything else

flask:
- db.py was run to make a simple db in database.db which just has two entries
     used the tutorial here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-an-sqlite-database-in-a-flask-application
     used DB Browser for SQLite to make sure the database looked okay
- cs555.py is the flask app which is still in work (only the home function works, index and delete are placeholders), it currently displays the title of the first database entry
- make sure gunicorn and flask are installed
- i made a python virtual env in the folder with:
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     pip install gunicorn flask
- make sure in virtual environment (venv/bin/activate) then start the flask app behind gunicorn with, this starts the app using port 5000:
     gunicorn --bind 127.0.0.1:5000 cs555:app

if you have nginx and gunicorn properly setup, you should be able to see the webpage which just says "Test1" at 127.0.0.1:5000 and at localhost in the browser


cloudlab:
- go to experiments, start experiment, pick profile as small lan, configure 2 nodes w/ ubuntu 24.x
- first, setup for nginx and gunicorn on the same node
- open shell for node0
	Sudo apt-get update (needed otherwise package installer can't find nginx/gunicorn)
	Sudo apt install nginx (at this point, i could see my nginx page at http://ms0826.utah.cloudlab.us/)
	Sudo apt install gunicorn
	Sudo apt install git (i think this was already installed)
	Git clone https://github.com/vibb19/csci555_project.git
	Go to project folder and run gunicorn same steps as locally (Had to bind to the external IP of the node, after that was able to see the flask app at http://ms0826.utah.cloudlab.us/:5000)
	Copy nginx sites-enabled cs555.conf from GitHub to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled, delete default conf already in the folder
	Restart nginx service (sudo systemctl restart service-name, sudo systemctl status service-name)
	Restart gunicorn binding to localhost (127.0.0.1:5000)
	Now you could be able to see the flask app at http://ms0826.utah.cloudlab.us/
- next, setup nginx and gunicorn running on different nodes (gunicorn on node0, nginx on node1)
- open shell for node1
	Sudo apt-get update (needed otherwise package installer can't find nginx/gunicorn)
	Sudo apt install nginx (verified i could see my nginx page at http://ms0828.utah.cloudlab.us/)
	Git clone https://github.com/vibb19/csci555_project.git
	Copy nginx sites-enabled cs555-multinode.conf (this is the same as cs555 but has the LAN ip 10.10.1.1 for node0) from GitHub to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled, delete default conf already in the folder
	Restart nginx service (sudo systemctl restart service-name, sudo systemctl status service-name)
- go back to node0 shell
	restart gunicorn binding to 10.10.1.1:5000
	verified can see flask app at http://ms0828.utah.cloudlab.us/
